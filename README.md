## Admetricks challenge

This is the first part of the admetricks challenge, that consist on creating two components:

- [X] Responsive landing page
- [X] D3 chart
- [ ] ~~AngularJS Microfront~~

The idea is to incorporate this components into an AngularJS App as a single-spa, containing the Vue app as a component with views...
But I couldn't do the AngularJs part because of time, I spend quite a while on learning D3, and I did enjoy it 

## To run this project
To compile use Node v16 or newer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phronesys/admetricks-challenge-vue
```

```
cd admetricks-challenge-vue && npm i && npm run dev
```

Will open the app in http://localhost:3000 on the landing page, click on any of the buttons in there or add `/chart` to the url to see the d3 chart.
