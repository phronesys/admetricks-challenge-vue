# Admetricks challenge
In this part I'm building the first part of the challenge, that consist on creating two components: 
- [ ] landing page
- [ ] D3 chart

The idea is to incorporate this components into an AngularJS App as a single-spa, containing the Vue app as a component with views

### Tools for this project
- vue 3 (script setup)
- vueuse
- vue-router
- typescript
- vitest (similar to jest with hmr)
- tailwindcss
